<h1>The Best Movies According to Dick Bickings</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-times</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>The first movie in the epic series, The Lord of the Rings, where we meet Frodo, a hobbit who is the unlikely character to dispose of the evil ring.</p>
<h3>The Two Towers</h3>
<p>The second movie in the Lord of the Rings epic, where we see two towers, one good and one evil, and how the good triumphs over evil.</p>
<h3>The Return of the King</h3>
<p>Strider, in the final movie of the Lord of the Rings epic series, is really the King of Gandor and this movie shows how Frodo and Sam destroy the evil ring, and Aeragor (Strider) becomes king.</p>
